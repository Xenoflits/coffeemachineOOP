This is a simple coffee machine simulation project built in Python. The project was created as a learning exercise to understand basic concepts of object-oriented programming, working with classes, and handling user input in Python.

## Features

- Reports the remaining resources in the coffee machine.
- Allows the machine to be turned off.

## How to Use
